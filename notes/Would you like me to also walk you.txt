Would you like me to also walk you through:

Setting up static files properly on Render?

Customizing the 404 and 500 error pages?

Setting up free HTTPS with Render (SSL certificate)?


Here are a few optional next steps you might want to think about:

âœ… Double-check the live site

Click around, test profile list, rating stars, comments, signup, login, leaderboard, etc.

âœ… Enable auto-deploy on Render (if you haven't already)

This way when you git push to GitHub, it automatically updates your live site.

âœ… Custom domain (optional for later)

Instead of a Render-provided URL, you can link a .com or .social domain.

âœ… Debug settings for production

Set DEBUG = False in your Render environment settings.

Add your Render hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS (like scoreboard-social.onrender.com).

âœ… Performance tweaks

(Optional) Later you might want to add caching, whitenoise optimization, or a CDN for media.

âœ… Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

You've built something real â€” that's no small thing. Go tell someone today!
