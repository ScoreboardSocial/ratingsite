📬 How to Set Up Render Deployment Email Notifications
Step 1: Go to Render.com
Log into your Render Dashboard.

Click into your project (your live Django site).

Step 2: Open "Settings" Tab
In the sidebar, click “Settings” for your service.

Step 3: Scroll Down to "Deploy Hook" or "Notifications"
Under Settings, scroll until you find:

Deploy Notifications

It’s usually near Environment / Build & Deploy sections.

Step 4: Add a Notification Email
Add your email address under the Deployment Notifications setting.

Choose when you want to be notified:

✅ On Successful Deployments (recommended)

✅ On Failed Deployments (recommended — so you know if something broke)

✅ That’s it!
Now every time you push to GitHub, Render will automatically:

Deploy the updated site.

Send you an email like:
"🎉 Deployment Succeeded on Scoreboard Social!"
or
"⚠️ Deployment Failed on Scoreboard Social"
