🔧 QUICK STYLE BOOSTS (Minimal Effort)
1. Varsity Theme Enhancements

Fonts: Add a sporty or collegiate font like Bebas Neue or [Anton].

Color Tweaks: Use strong contrasts: deep navy, varsity gold, bold red accents.

Badges: Use more stylized badges with icons for ratings, tags, fan favorites.

2. Button & Card Upgrades

Use animated hover effects (scale, glow, bounce).

Give buttons a 3D or soft shadow look.

Add subtle gradient overlays to cards.

🧩 COMPONENT-BASED POLISH (Moderate Effort)
3. Add UI Frameworks or Libraries

TailwindCSS: Great for utility-based, highly customizable designs.

Bootstrap 5: You’re likely already using it—just lean into its newer utilities (rounded-pill buttons, badges, etc.).

Animate.css: Add entrance animations, hover animations, etc.

4. Icon Packs

You're already using Font Awesome—lean in more!

Use Lucide or Heroicons for a clean look.
