Step-by-Step to Push the New Changes:
Open your terminal or command prompt
(Make sure you're inside your project folder:
Example: C:\Users\ishma\desktop\ratingsite)

Check what files have changed
Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git status
➔ This will show you that templates/base.html (and maybe others) have changed.

Stage the changes
This tells Git you want to commit these changes.

bash
Copy
Edit
git add templates/base.html
(or simply git add . to add everything that's changed if you prefer)

Commit the changes with a message
Now "lock in" your changes with a short note:

bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Update base.html with Google Analytics and new color palette"
Push the changes to GitHub
Finally send the changes to your GitHub repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git push
✅ That's it!
Within seconds, GitHub will show your new base.html, and Render (your hosting) will automatically detect the change and redeploy your site in the background.
